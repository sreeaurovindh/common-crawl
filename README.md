Deducing Structure of the Web
=============================

The goal of the project is to classify the structure of web pages based on the popularity across the web.  Pages with similar html layouts have similar html componenets. Hence DOM(Document Object Model) path of the leaf nodes approximately describes the visual location of the component in page rendering.
